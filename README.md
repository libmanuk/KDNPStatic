# KDNPStatic
This PHP code is used to produce static HTML pages using JSON files as a data source.

The resulting HTML pages are given ARK identifiers as filenames.  The ARKs are gathered from the JSON metadata.  The HTML pages are then stored in a pairtree_root directory structure.

BASH files are used to direct regeneration of pages by collections/title.

CSV files for loading into a MySQL database are also created.
